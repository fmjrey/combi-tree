(defn combinations-tree
  "Returns nested and mostly lazy sequences representing a tree of all the
  unique ways of taking n different elements from a sequence (i.e. elements at
  n distinct positions in the sequence) while preserving their original order.
  A branch in the tree is a sequence of at least 2 items, the first being
  the node and the rest being the children of that node. Nodes and leafs are
  items of the original collection so that each path in the tree provides a
  possible combination. The result of this function is a sequence of root
  children, meaning there is no root node in the first position.
  If the original collection contains duplicates, the resulting combinations
  will also contain duplicates. Use distinct-combinations-tree to get a tree
  that yields no duplicates.
  Examples:
    (combinations-tree [:k :s :k :s] 2)
    => ((:k :s :k :s) (:s :k :s) (:k :s))
    (combinations-tree [:k :s :k :s] 3)
    => ((:k (:s :k :s) (:k :s)) (:s (:k :s)))
  When only coll is provided as argument, this function returns a map of
  all combinations trees indexed by their size:
    (combinations-tree [:k :s :k :s])
    => {0 ()
        1 (:k :s :k :s), 
        2 ((:k :s :k :s) (:s :k :s) (:k :s)), 
        3 ((:k (:s :k :s) (:k :s)) (:s (:k :s))), 
        4 ((:k (:s (:k :s))))}
  Returns nil if n is 0 or greater than the size of coll.
  Throws an exception if n is negative or nil."
