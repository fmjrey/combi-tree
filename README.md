# combi-tree

A Clojure and ClojureScript library of combinatorics functions based on the
building of a combination tree. A combination tree is such that nodes and leafs
are items of an original collection so that each path in the tree provides a
possible combination of items of the original collection, while still
preserving their original order.

Combination trees are particularly useful when one needs to parse an input and
check if it's a non-ambiguous combination of items from a reference collection.
`combinations-tree` and `combinations` do not check for duplicates while
`distinct-combinations-tree` and `distinct-combinations` do. The value of this
library really lies in the latter two functions that handle duplicates because
they enable to quickly detect duplicates (ambiguous input).

This library provides functions to:
- generate a combination tree given an original collection,
- generate combinations given a previously generated combination tree,
- generate combinations given an original collection.

The functions that generate combinations are really there for convenience.
When no combination tree is required, it is best to use the more efficient
[match.combinatorics](https://github.com/clojure/math.combinatorics) library.

At the top level a combination tree is a sequence of root children, meaning
there is no root node at the head.
A branch in the tree is a sequence of at least 2 items, the first being
the node and the rest being the children of that node.

With the tree structure being made of sequences there is a risk of ambiguity if
the original collection also contains sequences (how to distinguish a sequence
that is part of the tree structure from a sequence that comes from the original
collection?). To avoid this situation, the sequences that are part of the
generated tree structure are tagged with a meta-data element
(see `with-tree-meta` function).
Consequently it's best to always use trees generated by this library.

```clojure
(ns example.core
  (:require [combi-tree.combi-tree :as combit]))

(combit/combinations-tree [1 2 3 4] 2)
;;=> ((1 2 3 4) (2 3 4) (3 4))
(combit/combinations-tree [1 2 3 4] 3)
;;=> ((1 (2 3 4) (3 4)) (2 (3 4)))
(combit/combinations-tree [1 1 3 4] 3)
;;=> ((1 (1 3 4) (3 4)) (1 (3 4)))
(combit/distinct-combinations-tree [1 1 3 4] 3)
;;=> ((1 (1 3 4) (3 (4 :combi-tree.combi-tree/dups))))
(combit/distinct-combinations [1 1 3 4] 3)
;;=> ((1 1 3) (1 1 4) (1 3 4))
(combit/combinations [1 1 3 4] 3)
;;=> ((1 1 3) (1 1 4) (1 3 4) (1 3 4))
